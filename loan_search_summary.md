# Loan Search System - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A comprehensive loan search and timeline system that allows searching across all transcripts to find and aggregate information about specific loan numbers.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Schema
- **loan_number_index**: Fast lookup table for loan numbers
- **user_loan_mapping**: Maps users to their loan numbers
- **call_transcripts_v2**: Stores summaries and transcript paths

### 2. Search API (`loan_search_api.py`)
- FastAPI server on port 8000
- Endpoints for searching by loan number or user
- Returns all calls mentioning a specific loan
- Provides analytics and user summaries

### 3. Timeline API (`loan_timeline_api.py`)
- FastAPI server on port 8001
- Creates comprehensive timelines for any loan number
- Aggregates summaries across all calls
- Extracts key milestones and sentiment trends
- Generates AI-powered insights:
  - Key issues identification
  - Action items extraction
  - Risk indicators
  - Compliance notes

### 4. React Components
- **LoanTimelineView.tsx**: Full-featured timeline visualization
  - Timeline tab: Chronological view of all calls
  - Insights tab: AI-generated analysis
  - Summary tab: Executive overview
- Supports searching any loan number
- Shows sentiment trends and milestones

## How It Works

1. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   Audio Files → Whisper → Transcripts → Gemma → Summaries → Database
                                           ↓
                                    Loan Number Extraction → Index
   ```

2. **Search Process**:
   - User enters loan number in React app
   - API queries indexed loan_number_index table
   - Joins with transcripts and metadata
   - Returns aggregated timeline

3. **One Loan Per Person**:
   - Eric Rawlins: Has one primary loan number
   - Celina Fischer: Has one primary loan number
   - Negin Rahimifar: Has one primary loan number
   - System tracks all mentions across multiple calls

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexed Search**: Loan numbers are pre-extracted and indexed
2. **Hybrid Storage**: Summaries in DB, full transcripts on filesystem
3. **Pre-calculated Mappings**: User-to-loan mappings cached
4. **Efficient Queries**: No JSON parsing in SQL queries

## Next Steps on RTX

Run on RTX 4090:
```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull

# 2. Process all recordings
python process_three_users_june.py

# 3. Start APIs
python loan_search_api.py      # Terminal 1
python loan_timeline_api.py    # Terminal 2

# 4. Test
curl http://localhost:8001/timeline/[LOAN_NUMBER]
```

## Sample Output

When searching for a loan number, the system provides:

```json
{
  "loan_number": "12345678",
  "total_calls": 15,
  "total_duration_minutes": 187,
  "primary_user": "Eric Rawlins",
  "timeline_events": [...],
  "aggregated_summary": "Comprehensive summary across all calls...",
  "key_milestones": [
    {
      "date": "2025-06-05",
      "type": "Approval",
      "description": "Loan modification approved..."
    }
  ],
  "sentiment_trend": {
    "positive": 8,
    "neutral": 5,
    "negative": 2
  }
}
```

The React interface provides a beautiful visualization of this data with interactive timeline, insights, and summary views.
