# 🌟 HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME - First Principles Build 🌟

## What This Does

Starting from absolutely nothing, this script creates a complete Hollywood-themed transcription environment with:

1. **Root Installation** - Uses passwordless sudo to install system-wide
2. **Isolated Environment** - Complete Python venv at `/opt/hollywood`
3. **Star Treatment** - Hollywood-themed transcription with screenplay output
4. **System Command** - `hollywood` command available from anywhere

## First Principles Approach

### 1. Check Prerequisites
- Verifies passwordless sudo (required for system install)
- Uses only Python stdlib and pip

### 2. Create Foundation
```bash
/opt/hollywood/
├── studio/       # Virtual environment
├── stars/        # Future scripts
├── scripts/      # Main transcription tools
├── models/       # Model storage
└── output/       # Results
    ├── screenplay/
    ├── detailed/
    └── json/
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
- numpy, scipy (audio processing)
- faster-whisper (transcription)
- pydub, wave (audio manipulation)

### 4. Create Star Script
- `hollywood_transcribe.py` - Main transcription with:
  - Screenplay formatting
  - Speaker detection (Actor A/B based on pauses)
  - Professional movie credits (metadata)

### 5. System Integration
- `/usr/local/bin/hollywood` - System-wide command
- Works from any directory
- Automatic environment activation

## Usage

### Install the Walk of Fame:
```bash
./create_hollywood_walkoffame.sh
```

### Transcribe (from anywhere):
```bash
hollywood your_audio.wav
```

### Output Example:
```
